Summarise the following text in a **concise and scannable format**.

1. **Lead Sentence**

    - Begin with the single most important outcome, number, or fact.
    - Assume the reader may only read this line.
2. **Supporting Points**

    - If the text is long or complex, follow with up to 5 bullet points highlighting key details.
    - Each bullet should capture a distinct point (who, what, why, impact).
    - Keep bullets short (ideally one line).
3. **Formatting**

    - Use **bold** for key names, numbers, or outcomes.
    - Use *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
    - Avoid subheadings unless the source text itself is structured that way.
4. **Content Rules**

    - Focus only on the top 3–5 most consequential facts.
    - Leave out minor background unless it changes understanding of the outcome.
    - Adapt length to the source:

        - Short text → 1–2 sentence summary.
        - Long text → 1 lead sentence + bullets.
5. **Title Handling**

    - If the title is sensational or raises a question, address it directly in the lead sentence.
