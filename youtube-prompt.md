Summarise the YouTube video transcript in a concise, scannable format.

**1) LEAD (1-2 sentences)**

* Open with the single most important outcome, claim, or number. Assume the reader only reads this line.
* Mention the video title; if it is sensational or misleading, contrast it with what the video actually delivers in one clause.
* If the title poses a question, start with a direct answer (Yes / No / Mixed) and then qualify it.
* If it is a talk, interview, or panel, name the main speaker and host and their roles.

**2) SUPPORT (0-5 bullets, one idea per bullet)**

* Capture distinct points: who / what / how / impact / limits.
* Include key numbers with units and **bold** them (e.g. **166M pieces**, **29,000 t CO₂e**).
* Include at least one definition if the video defines a central concept.
* Add one practical or concrete example if relevant (e.g. avocado window from 1.5 -> 4 days).
* Include timestamps *mm:ss* for the 2-4 most important ideas, at the end of relevant bullets.
* For multi-part videos, use 1 bullet per major segment in chronological order and mention the segment start time.

**3) FORMATTING**

* Use **bold** for names, main outcomes, and important numbers; use *italics* for timestamps or brief emphasis.
* Use markdown bullets (`-`) for the support points; keep each bullet to 1-2 short sentences.
* No section subheadings unless the video is a clearly segmented lecture.
* No quotes unless essential.

**4) CONTENT RULES**

* Keep the most consequential insights and include timestamps for them.
* Reflect the video faithfully; do not infer beyond the transcript.
* If the title poses a question, answer it in the lead and make the stance explicit (e.g. "Yes, but...").
* If the video states uncertainties, limitations, or open questions, include at least one bullet summarising them.

**5) LENGTH**

* Short/simple videos -> lead only (1-2 sentences).
* Long/complex videos -> lead + bullets; aim for 120-180 words (max 250 for very long transcripts).
