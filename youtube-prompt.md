Summarise the YouTube video transcript in a concise, scannable format.

1) LEAD (1–2 sentences)
- Open with the single most important outcome/number or claim. Assume the reader only reads this line.
- Mention the title; if it's sensational/misleading, contrast it with what the video actually delivers in one clause.

2) SUPPORT (0–5 bullets, one line each)
- Capture distinct points: who/what/how/impact/limits.
- Include key numbers with units and bold them (e.g., **166M pieces**, **29,000 t CO₂e**).
- Add one practical example if relevant (e.g., avocado window from 1.5 → 4 days).
- For longer videos, use section headings with timestamps in italics (e.g., *Introduction - 0:00*, *Main Argument - 5:30*).
- Avoid repeating the lead.

3) FORMATTING
- Use **bold** for names, outcomes, and numbers; *italics* for timestamps or brief emphasis.
- No section subheadings unless the video is a clearly segmented lecture.
- No quotes unless essential.

4) CONTENT RULES
- Keep only the 3–5 most consequential insights. Cut backstory and tangents.
- Reflect the video faithfully; do not infer beyond the transcript.
- If the title poses a question, answer it in the lead.

5) LENGTH
- Short/simple videos → lead only (1–2 sentences).
- Long/complex videos → lead + bullets; aim for 120–180 words (max 250 for very long transcripts).
